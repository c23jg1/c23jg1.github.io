	<h1>Julia's Coding Journal!</h1>
	<p>10/20/19</p>
	<p>I created my code journal :)</p>
	<br>
	<p>10/21/19</p>
	<p>Today I thought of ideas for the room and fixed my website a little!</p>
	<p>10/25/15</p>
	<p>Today I completed my room design codesketch :)</p>
	<p> 10/30/19</p>
	<p> I was able to adjust a few things on my website and finalized more of my ideas for my ocean project!</p>
	<p> 10/31/19</p>
	<p> My lab today was extremely eye opening! I just realized how interesting it is how every single website on the internet was first created just by simply using html. Wow!</p>
	<p> 11/12/19</p>
	<p> I really liked our tiktok conversation in class today. I think it is super important to discuss current events, specifically relating to the technology world. </p>
	<p> 11/19/19</p>
	<p> I've been having consistent labs and have been working on my ocean project. I now understand more about Javascript and more about its language.</p>
	<p> 12/13/19</p>
	<p> I added fiz buzz to my code journal by making it on scratch! I really liked making in on scratch, since I now understand all of the parts to the code. </p> 
	<p> 12/13/19</p>
	<p> I've also completed my array/function assignment in one project. I included a button, a randomizer feature and an array. </p>
	<p> 12/19/19 </p>
	<p> I've improved my ocean project more and am working on having it be ready for the kindergarteners! </p>
	<p> 1/29/20 </p>
	<p> I finished my magic trick project, and although I had forgotten some skills in Javascript this project definitely helped me remember how to use it. I'm super excited for our upcoming projects, especially since they're going to be more personal. </p>
	<p> 1/31/20 </p>
	<p> I'm currently up to date with all of my projects and have been thinking of new ideas for my future project. </p>
	<p> 2/10/20 </p>
	<p> I used my previous knowledge of functions from my prior code and was able to make my random generator for my valentine! </p>
	<p> 2/14/20 </p>
	<p> I completed my valentine and made sure that it was pushed to website and worked. </p>
	<p> 2/17/20 </p>
	<p> I've been brainstorming different possible projects that I can continue to pursure for the rest of the year of this semester atleast. I really want to work on something that I am passionate about, such as something related to mental health and bettering others or an app or device to help children and people with disabilities with communicating. </p>
	<p> 2/24/20 </p>
	<p> I've decided to focus my project on children for disabilities, more specifically for ones who are not able to communicate verbally. I'm now going to start researching for my project. </p>
	<p> 2/28/20 </p>
	<p> Afer doing more research I've learned that there are little to no apps reguarding communication and disabled children. I might not be able to make an app for communication, so I've now changed my idea slightly to a guide/manual for those living with a disabled family member. I think I am going to either continue with that idea or try and see if I can still create my application (my initial idea). </p>
	<p> 3/4/20 </p>
	<p> I've started drawing some possible mock ups for my website and am going to continue doing so! </p> 
	<p> 4/2/20 </p>
	<p> It's been a little while since I've done computer science, with corona and online school just starting again. For this assignment, we had to create an item that would make one feel invisible to security cameras on the street. I've decided to create an "invisible" hat, as I felt it could be easily worn. </p>
