	<p> My lab today was extremely eye opening! I just realized how interesting it is how every single website on the internet was first created just by simply using html. Wow!</p>

	<p> I really liked our tiktok conversation in class today. I think it is super important to discuss current events, specifically relating to the technology world. </p>

	<p> I've been having consistent labs and have been working on my ocean project. I now understand more about Javascript and more about its language.</p>

	<p> I added fiz buzz to my code journal by making it on scratch! I really liked making in on scratch, since I now understand all of the parts to the code. </p>

	<p> I've also completed my array/function assignment in one project. I included a button, a randomizer feature and an array. </p>
